Alright this is how it's gonna work, ally is gonna have all the respective labels and list of songs already co-existing from spotify what I want need to do is, ask her to put it in a structured json file 

then we make an cohere api call, and then ask it to get us the meaning of the song, and then we could use 
structed json tool at cohere and then make it generate the emotional labels

and we add this to the already existing json
